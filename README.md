# 02 Advanced CSS: Portfolio

For this project I wrote the HTML and CSS for my personal portfolio
I used advance CSS techniques such as flex box, CSS grid, hover attributs and more!  
The Navigation at the top will bring you to certain sections and the links work.  I look forward to
learing more and continueing to add to this!
